        checkered board

          <h3 style="font-family: courgette">Actions</h3>
          <p>
            Each player takes their turn by moving a piece. Pieces always move
            forwards diagonally to the next dark square.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a player's piece is in front of an opponent piece and there
            exists a vacant dark square immediately behind the opponent piece,
            the player must capture the piece and then move to the vacant dark
            square. The player can perform this action with the same piece
            multiple times if the opponent's pieces are lined up in the forward
            direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an opponent's piece is available to be captured, the player must
            capture the piece.

            style="text-align: center"
            width="250"
            height="250"
            class="rules-images"

        <div class="item1" style="margin-right: 80px">
          <h3 style="font-family: courgette">King Row</h3>
          <p>
            The row that is closest to each player is their king row. If a
            player's piece enters their opponent's king row, that piece becomes
            a king. In order to differentiate between kings and other pieces,
            one piece is placed upon the king piece.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a piece has been kinged, the player must wait until the next
            turn to move their king piece out of king row. Kings, unlike normal
            pieces, can move in both directions (forwards as well as backwards).
          </p>
          <h3 style="font-family: courgette">Winning</h3>
          <p class="last-para">
            You win the game when the opponent has no more pieces or can't move
            (even if they still has pieces). If neither of the players can
            move/wish to move, the players can agree to a draw
